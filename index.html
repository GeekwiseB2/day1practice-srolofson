    <p>I am here because I enjoy learning new things and was interested in exploring a possible career in technology. When I learned about Geekwise i decided to take the first class because i thought it would be a neat experience to have. I ended up loving code and decided to continue to see where this field in technology can take me. In this class, i am looking to see what else there is for me to learn in the world of code. </p>
